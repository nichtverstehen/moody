A LALR parser generator implemented as part of a university task.

Note, that the code is not particularly clean and optimal. Thus it is not ready for serious use.

For more information on constructing parsers refer to the Dragon Book (Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools by Alfred V. Aho, Monica S. Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey D. Ullman).
